You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

I love playing Spore when I was kid.  It is a game about the evolution of a species from unicellular organism to multi-planetary civilization.  You start out as a cell wandering around in the ocean.  You consume other animal and plant to get evolution point which can use to purchase traits and become more powerful.

As you become more powerful, other organism around you become more powerful.  You try to survive under increasing harsh competition, until you reach a threshold and move to land and become a animal.  As a animal, you have more options and can evolve in many different ways.  

I very interested in this type of game but Spore 2 never come out, and there not other game like this in the market.  I decide to recreate the cellular stage of it with my own twist.  I felt the increasing competitiveness was a scripted behaviour and it would be much better if it is a spontaneous process, i.e. the increasing competitiveness is a result of natural selection.  I felt it would be too long to generate complex behaviour and traits from natural selection, so I have to limit the possible trait space.  I can parametric the trait and train a reinforce learning agent to adjust those parameter.  I will create a reward function as the amount of food it can obtain.  

setup:
-ocean background
-agent: sensor from 8 direction and movement to 8 direction.
        Behaviour level optimization:
        sensor input -> neural network -> movement output
-gene of agent: size(dependent variable), weight(dependent variable),force, energy efficiency, life, damage.
